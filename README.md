# The Game Unnamed
 
## coding rules:
### All assets must be prefixed with like the following:
| Asset Type | Asset Prefix|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Object   | obj |
| Sprite   | spr |
| Room     | rm  |
| Tile Set | tls |
| Sound    | snd |
| Font     | fnt |
| Shader   | shd |

*Example: an Object asset called "dude" will be "objDude"*

*scripts I'll let slide cuz they don't really "exist" in gms2.3>*

### don't create path assets, don't create timeline assets they are dumb
